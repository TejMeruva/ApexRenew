# ApexRenew: Insurance Broker CoPilot

## Description
This is a project part of the Broker Co-Pilot Challenge of `IIT-Bombay TechFest 2025`. This tool is hosted as a website and provides a common platform for insurance brokers to view all their clients and associated information in a systematic manner. The tools broadly constitute:
1. A Renewal Pipeline with all clients prioritized 
2. AI based chatbot that assists the user in closing renewals.
3. A dashboard that shows brief updates and metrics to the user.

## Problem at Hand
Insurance broker agents have to juggle between multiple platforms (CRM platform like AppliedEpic, team collaboration platforms like MS Teams) as a part of their work in handling renewals. This begets a need for a unified platform that retrieves the data from these primary platforms and provides them to the user to make informed decisions. The idea is to minimise time wasted on tool usage and maximize broker renewal productivity.

## Technical Breakdown of Solution
1. **Data Retrieval:** Data is retreived from CRM and team collaboration platforms. *(For the sake of this implementation, MS Teams and Applied Epic have been considered.)*
   - Connecters to be used are the `MS Graph API` and `AppliedEpic API`.
   - Adapters to be used are scripts that perform merges on retrieved tables and data type conversions.
2. **Renewal Pipeline:** Upon user request only, the data is retrieved and preprocessing is done:
   - different tables are merged.
   - data in the wrong type is converted into the right data type.
   - The prioritization script is used to generate a GPA-kind priority score for each client based on multiple factors, namely:
     - time left till insurance expiry
     - premium amount at risk
     - user sentiment towards the insurer
     - level of ativity of the user
     - the predicted probability of user churn (done using a trained `XGB Model`)
   - Each of these factors is given a rating out of 10 and a weighted grade point average is calculated.
   - The weights of each factor is decided based on the influence of each factor on the user churn historically.
   - These weights have been decided based on feature imporatnces of each of the factors calculated by training a `Random Forest Classifier` to predict client churn status.
   - This weighted grade point avergae is the `client_priority_GPA`.
   - it is highly interpretable as its value can be justified based on the corresponding values of the grades of the underlying factors. 
   - E.g: if the GPA is 7.1, and the underlying grade for premium at risk is 5, the relatively lower GPA can be justified to lower due to the lower premium at risk.
   - A `Brief PDF` can be generated by one click for each client.
   - `E-Mail Templates` are generated using the `OpenAI API` and can be re-used for each client, personalized for each.
