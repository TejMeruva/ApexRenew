    "| **Quote** | The insurance carrier has reviewed the client's submission and formally offered a **price, terms, and conditions** for the requested coverage. | The broker can now present this offer to the client for acceptance or rejection. |\n",
    "| **Submitted** | The broker has formally **sent the client's application and risk information** to the carrier's underwriting team. | The submission is now actively pending the carrier's review and response (Quote, Declination, or Indication). |\n",
    "| **No Response** | The submission has been with the carrier for an excessive amount of time, and the broker has **not received any formal communication** (quote, decline, or status update). | This status flags poor carrier responsiveness and typically requires follow-up, or the broker must move on to other markets. |\n",
    "| **Bound** | The client has **accepted the carrier's quote**, and the policy has been formally **finalized and issued** by the carrier. | This signifies a successful placement and the end of the brokering process for that specific coverage. |\n",
    "| **Received** | This status often means the carrier has merely **acknowledged receipt** of the submission, but formal underwriting review has **not yet begun** or been completed. | It's an earlier stage than 'Submitted' or used for initial acknowledgment before moving to 'Submitted'. |\n",
    "| **Declination** | The carrier has officially **refused to offer coverage** or a quote for the client's risk. | The broker must understand the **Declination Reason** to pivot their strategy and approach other, more suitable carriers. |\n",
    "| **Not Taken Up (NTU)** | The carrier provided a quote, but the **client ultimately decided not to purchase** the policy from that carrier. | The client may have chosen a better quote from a competing carrier, or they may have decided not to buy the coverage at all. |\n",
    "| **Indication** | The carrier has provided a **non-binding, high-level estimate** of the premium (a \"ballpark figure\"). | An Indication is preliminary; it is *not* a final quote and is used to gauge market interest before spending time on a full, detailed submission. |\n"
